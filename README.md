- **Inter-Service Communication:** gRPC ⚡, Kafka 📨  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 🗄️  
- **Authentication:** JWT-based Authentication 🔐  
- **Testing:** JUnit, Mockito, Rest Assured ✅  
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (LocalStack) ☁️  
- **Containerization:** Docker 🐳  
- **API Gateway:** Authentication & Rate Limiting 🚦  

## 🎯 Key Features & Learnings 🏗️📚💡  

### 🔹 Microservices Architecture 🏛️🔄📊  
This project follows **production-grade coding standards** by implementing **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** and maintaining **separation of concerns**. DTOs play a crucial role in **protecting the database from direct interaction with the client request handling layer (i.e., the Controller layer)**. By using DTOs, the database and repository layers remain shielded from unnecessary exposure, ensuring **data integrity, security, and maintainability**. Additionally, **extra validation** can be applied at the DTO layer, preventing incorrect or malicious data from reaching the business logic and database. The system is specifically designed using a **microservices architecture**, keeping in mind future scalability while also serving as a learning experience. 📈📝🔍  

### 🔹 Efficient Communication Between Microservices ⚡🔄🔗  
- **gRPC** is used between the **Patient Service** and **Billing Service** for fast and efficient inter-service communication. ⚡  
- **Kafka** is used for communication between the **Patient Service** and **Analytics Service**, where patient events are published and consumed asynchronously. 📊🔀📡  

### 🔹 Security & Authentication 🔐🛡️🛠️  
- Implemented **JWT-based authentication**, designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers when required. 🔐  
- Set up an **API Gateway** to handle authentication checks, rate limiting, and prevent direct exposure of internal services. 🚦🔒📌

- ### 🔹 Dockerized Microservices 🐳🚀  
- Used **Docker** to containerize each microservice, ensuring easy deployment and consistent runtime environments.  
- Created **Docker Compose** configurations to manage inter-service dependencies efficiently.  
- Enabled **scalable deployment** of microservices across different environments with minimal setup. 

### 🔹 Testing & Reliability 🧪✅🔍  
- **Integration tests** are written using **Rest Assured** to validate API behavior. ✅  
- to ensure system reliability. 🧪📊🔄  

### 🔹 Cloud Infrastructure with AWS ☁️🌍🔧  
- Used **LocalStack** to emulate AWS services locally for development. ☁️  
- Leveraged AWS components like **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) 🏗️**, **MSK (Managed Kafka) 📬**, and **ALB (Application Load Balancer) 🌍** to build a cloud-ready architecture. 🛠️⚙️🔗  
- Configured **API Gateway** YAML file for proper routing before deployment. 📜📌📡  
 

## 📌 Conclusion 🎯💡🚀  
This project has significantly enhanced my understanding of scalable microservices architecture, cloud infrastructure, security best practices, and efficient API design. While there is always more to learn, i'll add more stuff and apply more features and concepts moving forward and refining my software engineering skills. 🏗️📚💻  !!!
